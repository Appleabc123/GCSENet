# GCSENet

    GCSENet is a novel learning-based framework for miRNA-disease association identification via graph convolutional neural networks、convolutional neural networks、Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks（SENet）

it contains: "code" and "data"

    In the "code" folder, the four steps correspond to "1.Generate Feature by GCN", "2.Feature Process" , "3.Train" , "4.Test" respectively.
    In the "data" folder， it contains four part : Generate feature、process feature、CNN_SENet、Test

The user can apply the whole framework to their interested dataset or only use part of the framework.
